    <h3> Below are instruction from the <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/posole-rojo-recipe-2119122"> Food Network</a> on how to properly prepare this dish. </h3>
    <ol>
            <li> Break the stems off the chiles de arbol and ancho chiles and shake out as many seeds as possible. Put the chiles in a bowl and cover with boiling water;</li>
            <br>
            <li> Weigh down the chiles with a plate to keep them submerged and soak until soft, about 30 minutes. Transfer the chiles and 1 1/2 cups of the soaking liquid to a blender.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Add the smashed garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt and blend until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pushing the sauce through with a rubber spatula; discard the solids</li>
            <br>
            <li> Rub the pork all over with the cumin and 1/2 teaspoon salt; set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Heat the vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic and cook 2 minutes. Increase the heat to medium high.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Push the onion and garlic to one side of the pot; add the pork to the other side and sear, turning, until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Stir in 2 cups water, the chicken broth, oregano, bay leaf, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of the chile sauce (depending on your taste).</li>
            <br>
            <li> Bring to a low boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Partially cover and cook, turning the pork a few times, until tender, about 3 hours. Stir in the hominy and continue to simmer, uncovered, until the pork starts falling apart, about 1 more hour.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Remove the bay leaf. Transfer the pork to a cutting board; roughly chop and return to the pot. </li>
            <br>
            <li> Add some water or broth if the posole is too thick. Season with salt.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Serve with assorted toppings and the remaining chile sauce.</li>
